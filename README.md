# ECE20875
Just my python solutions to Purdue's ECE 20875
I like having my work open for all to see because if it can help someone learn, then I am all for it.
If you are a student currently in Purdue ECE 20875, please don't use this to copy and not do your assignments because it's the only practice you get while handling the material before the exams.
